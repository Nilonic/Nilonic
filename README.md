# Welcome to My GitHub Profile!

Hello there! I'm nilon (or nilonic), a passionate developer hailing from the United Kingdom, specifically England. I'm thrilled to have you visit my GitHub profile, and I'd love to tell you a little bit about myself and my projects.

## About Me

I have been coding for some time now, and it's a true passion of mine. I enjoy exploring different technologies, experimenting with new concepts, and building exciting projects. While I may be a bit slow at responding to messages, please rest assured that I will get back to you eventually. Your patience is greatly appreciated!

## My Projects

### fnf+

One of my primary projects is fnf+, a dynamic endeavor that serves as a pivot point for client developers. fnf+ aims to provide a solid foundation for clients and even encourages the creation of competitive mods for FNF (Friday Night Funkin'). It's an ongoing project that I'm deeply invested in, and I'm eager to resume development on it in the near future.

### <a href="https://nilonic.github.io/openPOS/" style="color: black;">openPOS</a>

Another significant project I'm currently working on is openPOS. This project is still in development, and I'm actively refining its features. openPOS is an exciting venture that focuses on building a powerful and versatile open-source point-of-sale (POS) system. I believe in creating practical solutions that can be accessible to all, and openPOS is one of my endeavors in that direction.

## My Icon

Lastly, you may have noticed my """unique icon""". It was created using DALLÂ·E 2, an AI model developed by OpenAI. I have no reason to use it but why not.
