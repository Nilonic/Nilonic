# Welcome to My GitHub Profile!

Hello there! I'm nilon (or nilonic), a passionate developer hailing from the United Kingdom, specifically England. I'm thrilled to have you visit my GitHub profile, and I'd love to tell you a little bit about myself and my projects.

## About Me

I have been coding for some time now, and it's a true passion of mine. I enjoy exploring different technologies, experimenting with new concepts, and building exciting projects. While I may be a bit slow at responding to messages, please rest assured that I will get back to you eventually. Your patience is greatly appreciated!

## My Projects

### fnf+

One of my primary projects is fnf+, a dynamic endeavor that serves as a pivot point for client developers. fnf+ aims to provide a solid foundation for clients and even encourages the creation of competitive mods for FNF (Friday Night Funkin'). It's an ongoing project that I'm deeply invested in, and I'm eager to resume development on it in the near future.

### openPOS

Another significant project I'm currently working on is openPOS. This project is still in development, and I'm actively refining its features. openPOS is an exciting venture that focuses on building a powerful and versatile open-source point-of-sale (POS) system. I believe in creating practical solutions that can be accessible to all, and openPOS is one of my endeavors in that direction.

## My Coding Style

Now, let's talk about my coding style. I'll be honest; my code can be a bit of a mixed bag. Approximately 90% of it could be considered "spaghetti" code, which means it might appear complex and interconnected. However, the remaining 10% is dedicated to writing clean, readable code. I strive to improve my skills continuously, and while my code may not be perfect, I'm always working towards enhancing its readability and maintainability.

## Project Commitment

In the past, I've had a habit of abandoning some of my projects. However, this is not the case with fnf+ and openPOS. These projects hold a special place in my heart, and I'm committed to their continued development and growth. I understand the importance of consistency and ensuring that the projects I undertake reach their full potential.

## My Icon

Lastly, you may have noticed my unique icon. It was created using DALLÂ·E 2, a fascinating AI model developed by OpenAI. I find it to be an excellent representation of my personality and creativity.

Thank you for taking the time to read my GitHub profile's custom description. I hope it provided you with some insight into who I am as a developer and what I'm currently working on. If you have any questions or would like to collaborate on a project, feel free to reach out. I look forward to connecting with you soon!
